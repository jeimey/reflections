What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It starts the process of tracking the versions of the files within that 
directory.
You just go into the directory and type "git init", and then that 
directory becomes a git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's a place to decide what files to place in each commit -- no, I though
all files in the repository are saved with a commit.
