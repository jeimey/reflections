When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?
a. to have a backup in the cloud
b. to collaborate and/or share with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually 
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
 - you might want to disregard changes from the cloud
 - someone else might make bad changes and you don't
 want to download them.
